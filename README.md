# FirmSheet_AAU_ADE

Create Firm sheets for Carrier Routes and Return Merchandise. Scan a single barcode and generate the Arrival at Unit and Acceptable Delivery Event (ADE) scans for the Delivery Unit for all pieces associated with that firm sheet.

## Features

- **Firm Sheet Management**: Create and manage firm sheets for Carrier Routes and Return Merchandise
- **Barcode Scanning**: Scan any barcode from a firm sheet to trigger scan event generation
- **Automatic Scan Generation**: Generate both AAU (Arrival at Unit) and ADE (Acceptable Delivery Event) scans for all mail pieces on the firm sheet
- **Delivery Unit Support**: Target specific delivery units for scan events
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface for all operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 or later

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the FirmSheetManager directory:
   ```bash
   cd FirmSheetManager
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```

### Usage

The application starts with sample data containing:
- 1 Carrier Route firm sheet with 3 mail pieces
- 1 Return Merchandise firm sheet with 2 mail pieces

#### Main Functions

1. **Scan Barcode**: Enter any tracking number from the sample data to generate AAU/ADE events
   - Sample Carrier Route tracking: `9400111202555003456787`
   - Sample Return Merchandise tracking: `RM9400111202555003456790`

2. **Create New Firm Sheet**: Set up new firm sheets for different delivery units

3. **View All Firm Sheets**: Display all firm sheets and their status

4. **Add Mail Pieces**: Add new mail pieces to existing firm sheets

#### Sample Output

When scanning a barcode, the system generates:
- **AAU (Arrival at Unit)** scans for all pieces on the firm sheet
- **ADE (Acceptable Delivery Event)** scans 30 minutes later for all pieces
- Detailed event log with timestamps, tracking numbers, and locations
